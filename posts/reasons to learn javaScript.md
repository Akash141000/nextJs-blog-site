The most obvious reason for learning JavaScript is if you have hopes of becoming a web developer. Even if you haven’t got your heart set on a tech career, being proficient in this language will enable you to build websites from scratch—a pretty useful skill to have in today’s job market!

If you do want to become a web developer, here are some of the main reasons why you should learn JavaScript:
- JavaScript experts are versatile
- JavaScript experts are in-demand (and well-paid)
- JavaScript is beginner-friendly

When deciding whether or not to learn this language, what you’re really asking is whether or not you should learn “vanilla” JavaScript. Vanilla JavaScript just means the basic language without any libraries or frameworks.

When it comes to learning the language, it can be tempting to skip ahead to those time-saving frameworks and libraries. However, there are many compelling arguments for learning plain JavaScript first.

While JavaScript frameworks may help you get the job done quicker, there’s only so far you can go if you don’t understand the core concepts behind these frameworks.
